# Crambarry.com
[Crambarry.com](https://crambarry.com) is an online gamified classroom web app, designed to replace that crummy Instagram group chat
involuntarily created by that one student who tries too hard. The website features a roulette rewards system, player customizability, multi-user flashcard generator, and discussion/question forums.
